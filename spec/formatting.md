# DRAFT MessageFormat 2.0 Formatting

## Introduction

This document defines the behaviour of a MessageFormat 2.0 implementation
when formatting a message for display in a user interface, or for some later processing.

To start, we presume that a _message_ has either been parsed from its syntax
or created from a data model description.
If this construction has encountered any _Syntax Errors_ or _Data Model Errors_,
an appropriate error MUST be emitted and a _fallback value_ MAY be used as the formatting result.

## Runtime Values

An _annotated formattable value_ is an intermediate structure in formatting.
The interface for formatting functions and selector functions
requires the _annotated formattable value_ to be isomorphic to
these functions' argument type.
It bundles an implementation-specific _formattable value_ with metadata
and with an optional _formatted value_.
Although the details of a _formattable value_ are implementation-specific,
it should contain everything required by the eventual formatting.

An _annotated formattable value_ MUST include the following field:
* 'source-text': A string representation of the message
  that was ultimately used to create this _annotated formattable value_.
  This field MAY be the empty string if the 'fallback' field is present
  and MUST be non-empty otherwise.

and must include **exactly one** of
the following fields:
* `fallback`: An arbitrary string.
   If present, this value is presumed to represent
   an error that occurred during formatting or selection.
* 'formattable-value': A _formattable value_.
* 'preformatted-value': A _preformatted value_.

A _preformatted value_ MUST include the following fields:
* `options`: A list of options that were passed to the formatting function
   that produced this _annotated formattable value_ (if applicable).
   It may be empty.
* `formatter`: The name of the formatting function that produced
   this _annotated formattable value_, or a distinguished value to
   indicate that it arose from an unformatted _literal_, external message
   argument, or local _variable_ reference.
* `formatter-input`: Another _annotated formattable value_
  representing the argument passed to the formatter
  to create this _preformatted value_.
* `formatter-output`: An implementation-dependent
  _formatted value_.

Implementations MAY extend this definition with additional fields.

A _fallback value_ is an _annotated formattable value_ with a non-empty
string in the `fallback` field.

The _fallback_ of an _annotated formattable value_ is a string.
The string is defined as follows:
* If the `fallback` field is present, then the _fallback_ is its value.
* Otherwise, the _fallback_ is the value of the `source-text` field.

The name of an external message argument is bound to a
_formattable value_ while formatting the message.

A _nameable value_ is an implementation-defined intermediate structure in formatting.
The relationship between a _nameable value_ and an _annotated formattable value_
is also implementation-specific.
In an implementation with eager evaluation, the set of _nameable value_s
and _annotated formattable value_s might be the same.
In an implementation with lazy evaluation, a _nameable value_
might be a thunk (suspended value) that
is evaluated to an _annotated formattable value_
before a call to a formatting function.
A _nameable value_ must at minimum contain
some representation of the underlying _expression_ that must be evaluated
to _force_ this _nameable value_ to an _annotated formattable value_,
and a list of _variables_ that are in scope when evaluating the _expression_.

The output of the formatter is a sequence of one or more _formatted values_.
A _formatted value_ is implementation-defined. Some implementations might
only allow formatting to strings or numbers.
Others might provide a richer language of _formatted values_.

Since a _variable_ can be referenced in different ways,
an _annotated formattable value_ should include all the information
needed for a potential chain of formatting operations
to re-format the same value.
In other words, an _annotated formattable value_ can't
merely be a _formatted value_.

A _markup value_ contains the following fields:
* `type`: Either `open`, `standalone`, or `close`.
* `markup`: The string that is the _identifier_ of the markup.
* `options`: A mapping from _option_ names to _formattable values_,
  representing the resolved _option_ values after _option resolution_.

Some implementations might provide means to format a message
to a sequence of _formatted values_ ("formatting to parts").

## Operations

Formatting of a _message_ is defined by the following operations:

- **_Expression and Markup Resolution_** produces a
  _nameable value_ from an _expression_
  or a _markup value_ from _markup_,
  with reference to the current _formatting context_.
  This can include multiple steps,
  such as looking up the value of a variable and calling formatting functions.

  The resolution of _text_ is rather straightforward,
  and is detailed under _literal resolution_.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> **This specification does not require either eager or lazy _expression resolution_ of _message_
> parts; do not construe any requirement in this document as requiring either.**

> In particular, an implementation MAY choose not to compute an
> _annotated formattable value_ from any given _nameable value_
> until the _nameable value_ is actually required by a
> selection or formatting process.

- **_Forcing_** produces an _annotated formattable value_ from a _nameable value_.
  The details are implementation-specific. In an eager implementation, it may be
  the identity function.
  We say that a _nameable value_ is _demanded_ if, during _forcing_, it needs to be
  resolved to an _annotated formattable value_ to determine the
  _annotated formattable value_ of a larger expression (for example, when a
  variable reference is looked up).

- **_Pattern Selection_** determines which of a message's _patterns_ is formatted.
  For a message with no _selectors_, this is simple as there is only one _pattern_.
  With _selectors_, this will depend on their resolution.

  At the start of _pattern selection_,
  if the _message_ contains any _reserved statements_,
  emit an _Unsupported Statement_ error.

- **_Formatting_** takes the selected _pattern_,
  and produces the formatted result for the _message_.
  Depending on the implementation, this result could be a single concatenated string,
  an array of objects, an attributed string, or some other locally appropriate data type.


Formatter implementations are not required to expose
the _expression resolution_ and _pattern selection_ operations to their users,
or even use them in their internal processing,
as long as the final _formatting_ result is made available to users
and the observable behavior of the formatter matches that described here.

## Formatting Context

A message's **_formatting context_** represents the data and procedures that are required
for the message's _expression resolution_, _pattern selection_ and _formatting_.

At a minimum, it includes:

- Information on the current **_locale_**,
  potentially including a fallback chain of locales.
  This will be passed on to formatting functions.

- Information on the base directionality of the _message_ and its _text_ tokens.
  This will be used by strategies for bidirectional isolation,
  and can be used to set the base direction of the _message_ upon display.

- An **_<dfn>input mapping</dfn>_** of string identifiers to
  _formattable values_,
  defining variable values that are available during _variable resolution_.
  This is often determined by a user-provided argument of a formatting function call.

- The _function registry_,
  providing the implementations of the functions referred to by message _functions_.

- Optionally, a fallback string to use for the message
  if it contains any _Syntax Errors_ or _Data Model Errors_.

Implementations MAY include additional fields in their _formatting context_.

## Expression and Markup Resolution

_Expressions_ are used in _declarations_, _selectors_, and _patterns_.
_Markup_ is only used in _patterns_.

In a _declaration_, the _variable_ of the _declaration_
is bound to the _nameable value_ of the _declaration_'s _expression_.
This binding may be used when determining the _nameable value_
of a subsequent _expression_.

In an _input-declaration_, the _variable_ of the _input-declaration_
is bound to the _nameable value_ of the _declaration_'s _variable-expression_.
(An _expression_ and a _variable-expression_ are resolved identically,
given the relevant formatting context and bindings for previous _declaration_s.)

In _selectors_, an _expression_ is resolved to a _nameable value_ and then _forced_
to an _annotated formattable value_.
This value is then used for _pattern selection_.

Within a _pattern_, an _expression_ is resolved to a _nameable value_ and then _forced_
to an _annotated formattable value_, which is then used in the pattern's formatting.
A _markup_ is resolved to a _markup value_, which is then used in the pattern's formatting.

The forms that _nameable values_ and _formattable values_ take are implementation-dependent.

> For example, the _annotated formattable value_ of the _expression_
> `{|0.40| :number style=percent}`
> could be an object such as
>
> ```
> { source-text: '{|0.40| :number style=percent}',
>   preformatted-value:
>     { options: { 'style': { source-text: 'percent', formattable-value: 'percent' }},
>       formatter: Some(NumberFormat),
>       formatter-input: { source-text: '|0.40|',
>                          formattable-value: '0.40' },
>       formatter-output: /* implementation-specific */ }}
> ```
>
> Since this is a formatter call, the 'formatter-input'
> field of the 'preformatted-value' field must have a 'formattable-value'
> field, but the contents of this field
> are dependent on the implementation's definition of a _formattable value_.
> Likewise, the contents of the 'formatter-output` field of the
> `preformatted-value` field are dependent on the implementation's
> definition of a _formatted value_.
> For example,
> it could be an instance of an ICU4J `FormattedNumber`,
> or some other locally appropriate value.

> NOTE: the following assumes eager evaluation;

> implementations are free to use any representation of a _nameable value_
> that includes the information necessary to obtain observably identical
> results to the following description.

When a _nameable value_ is _forced_ (when it is passed to a formatter
or selector function; used in _pattern selection_; or used in formatting
a _pattern_), the following describes how an _annotated formattable value_
is obtained from the _nameable value_, which is presumed to include
a representation of the source _expression_.
In an eager implementation, _nameable values_ are just
_annotated formattable values_ and the following describes how
an _annotated formattable value_ is obtained from an _expression_.

Depending on the presence or absence of a _variable_ or _literal_ operand
and a _function_, _private-use annotation_, or _reserved annotation_,
the _annotated formattable value_ of the _expression_ is determined as follows:

If the _expression_ contains a _reserved annotation_,
an _Unsupported Expression_ error is emitted and
a _fallback value_ is used as the _annotated formattable value_
of the _expression_.

Else, if the _expression_ contains a _private-use annotation_,
its _annotated formattable value_ is defined according to the implementation's specification.

Else, if the _expression_ contains an _annotation_,
its _annotated formattable value_ is defined by _function resolution_.

Else, if the _expression_ consists of a _variable_,
its _annotated formattable value_ is defined by _variable resolution_.
An implementation MAY perform additional processing
when determining the inner _formattable value_ of the _expression_'s
_annotated formattable value_.

> For example, it could apply _function resolution_ using a _function_
> and a set of _options_ chosen based on the value or type of the _variable_.
> So, given a _message_ like this:
>
> ```
> Today is {$date}
> ```
>
> If the value passed in the _variable_ were a date object,
> such as a JavaScript `Date` or a Java `java.util.Date` or `java.time.Temporal`,
> the implementation could interpret the _expression_ `{$date}` as if
> the pattern included the function `:datetime` with some set of default options.

Else, the _expression_ consists of a _literal_.
Its _annotated formattable value_ is defined by _literal resolution_.

> **Note**
> This means that a _literal_ value with no _annotation_
> is always treated as a string.
> To represent values that are not strings as a _literal_,
> an _annotation_ needs to be provided:
>
> ```
> .local $aNumber = {1234 :number}
> .local $aDate = {|2023-08-30| :datetime}
> .local $aFoo = {|some foo| :foo}
> {{You have {42 :number}}}
> ```

### Literal Resolution

The _annotated formattable value_ of a _text_ or a _literal_ is as follows:
```
{ source-text: T
  formattable-value: C }
```

where `T` represents the source text of the _text_ or _literal_,
and `C` represents the character sequence of the _text_ or _literal_
after any character escape has been converted to the escaped character.

When a _literal_ is used as an _operand_
or on the right-hand side of an _option_,
the formatting function MUST produce the same _formattable value_
regardless of whether the _literal_ was originally _quoted_ or _unquoted_.

> For example,
> the _option_ `foo=42` and the _option_ `foo=|42|` are treated as identical.

The `formattable-value` field
of the _annotated formattable value_ that a _text_ or _literal_ resolves to
MUST be a string.

### Variable Resolution

To determine the _annotated formattable value_ of a _variable_,
its _name_ is used to identify either a local variable or an input variable.
If a _declaration_ exists for the _variable_, its _nameable value_ is used.
Otherwise, the _variable_ is an implicit reference to an input value,
and its _formattable value_ is looked up from the _formatting context_ _input mapping_.

An eager implementation would produce an _annotated formattable value_
from this (externally defined) _formattable value_ as follows:

```
{ source-text: '$'V
  formattable-value: FV }
```

where `V` is the name of the input variable
and `FV` is the _formattable value_ bound to this input variable
in the _formatting context_ _input mapping_.

The resolution of a _variable_ MAY fail if no _nameable value_
is identified for its _name_.
If this happens, an _Unresolved Variable_ error MUST be emitted.
If the _annotated formattable value_ of a _demanded_ _nameable value_
is a  _fallback value_,
this MUST also be considered a failure.

### Function Resolution

When a _nameable value_ representing
an _expression_ with a _function_ _annotation_
is _forced_, the following steps are taken to resolve the _expression_
to an _annotated formattable value_ `AFV`:

1. If the _expression_ includes an _operand_, resolve the _operand_
   to an _annotated formattable value_.
   If this fails,
   `AFV` is a _fallback value_.
2. Resolve the _identifier_ of the _function_ and, based on the starting sigil,
   find the appropriate function implementation to call.
   If the implementation cannot find the function,
   or if the _identifier_ includes a _namespace_ that the implementation does not support,
   emit an _Unknown Function_ error.
   `AFV` is a _fallback value_.

   Implementations are not required to implement _namespaces_ or installable
   _function registries_.

3. Perform _option resolution_.

4. Call the function implementation with the following arguments:

   - The current _locale_.
   - The resolved mapping of _options_.
   - If the _expression_ includes an _operand_, its _annotated formattable value_.

   The form that _option_ values take is implementation-defined.

   An implementation MAY pass additional arguments to the function,
   as long as reasonable precautions are taken to keep the function interface
   simple and minimal, and avoid introducing potential security vulnerabilities.

   An implementation MAY define its own functions.
   An implementation MAY allow custom functions to be defined by users.

   Function access to the _formatting context_ MUST be minimal and read-only,
   and execution time SHOULD be limited.

   Implementation-defined _functions_ SHOULD use an implementation-defined _namespace_.

5. If the call succeeds,
   `AFV` is the result of that function call.
   If the call fails or does not return a valid value,
   emit a _Resolution Error_.
   `AFV` is a _fallback value_.

#### Option Resolution

The result of resolving _option_ values is a mapping of string identifiers to
_formattable values._

For each _option_:

- Resolve the _identifier_ of the _option_.
- If the _option_'s _identifier_ already exists in the resolved mapping of _options_,
   emit a _Duplicate Option Name_ error.
- If the _option_'s right-hand side successfully resolves to an _annotated formattable value_,
  bind the _identifier_ of the _option_ to this _annotated formattable value_
  in the mapping.
- Otherwise, bind the _identifier_ of the _option_ to a _fallback value_
   in the mapping.
   Implementations MAY later remove this value before calling the _function_.
   (Note that an _Unresolved Variable_ error will have been emitted.)

Errors MAY be emitted during _option resolution_,
but it always resolves to some mapping of string identifiers to _annotated formattable values_.
This mapping can be empty.

### Markup Resolution

Unlike _functions_, the resolution of _markup_ is not customizable.

A _markup_ item resolves to a _nameable value_ that can be _forced_ to
a _markup value_ with:
* `type` set to the type of the markup
* `markup` set to the identifier of the markup
* options` set to the resolved _options_ values after _option resolution_.

The resolution of _markup_ MUST always succeed.

### Fallback Resolution

A **_fallback value_** is an _annotated formattable value_ representing an
_expression_ that failed to resolve.

An _expression_ fails to resolve when:

- A _variable_ used as an _operand_ (with or without an _annotation_) fails to resolve
  to a _nameable value_.
  * Note that this does not include a _variable_ used as an _option_ value.
- A _function_ _annotation_ fails to resolve to a function definition.
- A _private-use annotation_ is unsupported by the implementation or if
  a _private-use annotation_ fails to resolve.
- The _expression_ has a _reserved annotation_.

The `fallback` field of the _fallback value_ depends on the contents of the _expression_:

- _expression_ with _literal_ _operand_ (_quoted_ or _unquoted_):
  U+007C VERTICAL LINE `|`
  followed by the value of the _literal_
  with escaping applied to U+005C REVERSE SOLIDUS `\` and U+007C VERTICAL LINE `|`,
  and then by U+007C VERTICAL LINE `|`.

  > Examples:
  > In a context where `:func` fails to resolve,
  > `{42 :func}` resolves to a _fallback value_ with `fallback: |42|` and
  > `{|C:\\| :func}` resolves to a _fallback value_ with `fallback: |C:\\|`.
  > In any context, `{|| @reserved}` resolves to a _fallback value_ with `fallback: ||`.

- _expression_ with _variable_ _operand_ referring to a local _declaration_ (with or without an _annotation_):
  the _fallback_ of the _annotated formattable_value_ to which it resolves
  (which may already be a _fallback value_)

  > Examples:
  > In a context where `:func` fails to resolve,
  > the _pattern_'s _expression_ in `.local $var={|val|} {{{$val :func}}}`
  > resolves to the following _fallback value_:
  >
  > { source-text: '{$val :func}',
  >   fallback: '|val|' }
  > and the message formats to `{|val|}`.
  >
  > In a context where `:now` fails to resolve but `:datetime` does not,
  > the _pattern_'s _expression_ in
  > ```
  > .local $t = {:now format=iso8601}
  > .local $pretty_t = {$t :datetime}
  > {{{$pretty_t}}}
  > ```
  > resolves to the following _fallback value_:
  > ```
  > { source-text: '{$pretty_t}',
  >   fallback: ':now'
  > }
  > ```
  > Working backwards, this is because the expression `{$t :datetime}`
  > resolves to the following _fallback value_:
  > ```
  > { source-text: '{$t :datetime}`,
  >   fallback: ':now' }
  > ```
  > and likewise, the operand `$t` resolves to:
  > ```
  > { source-text: '{:now format=iso8661}',
  >   fallback: ':now' }
  > ```
  > So transitively, the _fallback_ of the _annotated resolved value_ of the
  > _pattern_'s _expression_ is `now` and
  > the message formats to `{:now}`.

- _expression_ with _variable_ _operand_ not referring to a local _declaration_ (with or without an _annotation_):
  U+0024 DOLLAR SIGN `$` followed by the _name_ of the _variable_

  > Examples:
  > In a context where `$var` fails to resolve, `{$var}` and `{$var :number}` and `{$var @reserved}`
  > all resolve to a _fallback value_ whose _fallback_ is `$var`.
  > In a context where `:func` fails to resolve,
  > the _pattern_'s _expression_ in `.input $arg {{{$arg :func}}}`
  > resolves to a _fallback value_ whose _fallback_ is `$arg` and
  > the message formats to `{$arg}`.

- _function_ _expression_ with no _operand_:
  U+003A COLON `:` followed by the _function_ _identifier_

  > Examples:
  > In a context where `:func` fails to resolve, `{:func}` resolves to a _fallback value_
  > whose _fallback_ is `:func`.
  > In a context where `:ns:func` fails to resolve, `{:ns:func}` resolves to a _fallback value_
  > whose _fallback_ is `:ns:func`.

- unsupported _private-use annotation_ or _reserved annotation_ with no _operand_:
  the _annotation_ starting sigil

  > Examples:
  > In any context, `{@reserved}` and `{@reserved |...|}` both resolve to a _fallback value_
  > whose _fallback_ is `@`.

- supported _private-use annotation_ with no _operand_:
  the _annotation_ starting sigil, optionally followed by implementation-defined details
  conforming with patterns in the other cases (such as quoting literals).
  If details are provided, they SHOULD NOT leak potentially private information.

  > Examples:
  > In a context where `^` expressions are used for comments, `{^▽^}` might resolve to a _fallback value_
  > whose _fallback_ is `^`.
  > In a context where `&` expressions are _function_-like macro invocations, `{&foo |...|}` might resolve to
  > a _fallback value_ whose _fallback_ is `&foo`.

- Otherwise: the U+FFFD REPLACEMENT CHARACTER `�`

  This is not currently used by any expression, but may apply in future revisions.

A _fallback value_ does not have a `preformatted-value` field and thus
does not include _option_ _identifiers_ and values).

_Pattern selection_ is not supported for _fallback values_.

## Pattern Selection

When a _message_ contains a _matcher_ with one or more _selectors_,
the implementation needs to determine which _variant_ will be used
to provide the _pattern_ for the formatting operation.
This is done by ordering and filtering the available _variant_ statements
according to their _key_ values and selecting the first one.

The number of _keys_ in each _variant_ MUST equal the number of _selectors_.

Each _key_ corresponds to a _selector_ by its position in the _variant_.

> For example, in this message:
>
> ```
> .match {:one} {:two} {:three}
> 1 2 3 {{ ... }}
> ```
>
> The first _key_ `1` corresponds to the first _selector_ (`{:one}`),
> the second _key_ `2` to the second _selector_ (`{:two}`),
> and the third _key_ `3` to the third _selector_ (`{:three}`).

To determine which _variant_ best matches a given set of inputs,
each _selector_ is used in turn to order and filter the list of _variants_.

Each _variant_ with a _key_ that does not match its corresponding _selector_
is omitted from the list of _variants_.
The remaining _variants_ are sorted according to the _selector_'s _key_-ordering preference.
Earlier _selectors_ in the _matcher_'s list of _selectors_ have a higher priority than later ones.

When all of the _selectors_ have been processed,
the earliest-sorted _variant_ in the remaining list of _variants_ is selected.

This selection method is defined in more detail below.
An implementation MAY use any pattern selection method,
as long as its observable behavior matches the results of the method defined here.

If the message being formatted has any _Syntax Errors_ or _Data Model Errors_,
the result of pattern selection MUST be a pattern resolving to a single _fallback value_
whose `fallback` field is the message's fallback string defined in the _formatting context_
or if this is not available or empty, the U+FFFD REPLACEMENT CHARACTER `�`.

### Resolve Selectors

First, resolve the values of each _selector_:

1. Let `res` be a new empty list of _annotated formattable values_ that support selection.
1. For each _selector_ `sel`, in source order,
   1. Let `rv` be the _annotated formattable value_ of `sel` (_forcing_ its
      intermediate _nameable value_ to an _annotated formattable value_ if necessary).
   1. If selection is supported for `rv`:
      1. Append `rv` as the last element of the list `res`.
   1. Else:
      1. Let `nomatch` be an _annotated formattable value_ for which selection always fails.
      1. Append `nomatch` as the last element of the list `res`.
      1. Emit a _Selection Error_.

The manner of determining an _annotated formattable value_'s support for selection
is determined by each implementation.

### Resolve Preferences

Next, using `res`, resolve the preferential order for all message keys:

1. Let `pref` be a new empty list of lists of strings.
1. For each index `i` in `res`:
   1. Let `keys` be a new empty list of strings.
   1. For each _variant_ `var` of the message:
      1. Let `key` be the `var` key at position `i`.
      1. If `key` is not the catch-all key `'*'`:
         1. Assert that `key` is a _literal_.
         1. Let `ksV` be the _annotated formattable value_ of `key`.
         1. Assert that `ksV` has a `formattable-value` field with value `ks`.
         1. Assert that `ks` is a string.
         1. Append `ks` as the last element of the list `keys`.
   1. Let `rv` be the _annotated formattable value_ at index `i` of `res`.
   1. Let `matches` be the result of calling the method MatchSelectorKeys(`rv`, `keys`)
   1. Append `matches` as the last element of the list `pref`.

The method MatchSelectorKeys is determined by the implementation.
It takes as arguments an _annotated formattable value_ `rv`
(representing the result of resolving a _selector_),
and a list of string keys `keys`,
and returns a list of string keys in preferential order.
The returned list MUST contain only unique elements of the input list `keys`.
The returned list MAY be empty.
The most-preferred key is first,
with each successive key appearing in order by decreasing preference.

### Filter Variants

Then, using the preferential key orders `pref`,
filter the list of _variants_ to the ones that match with some preference:

1. Let `vars` be a new empty list of _variants_.
1. For each _variant_ `var` of the message:
   1. For each index `i` in `pref`:
      1. Let `key` be the `var` key at position `i`.
      1. If `key` is the catch-all key `'*'`:
         1. Continue the inner loop on `pref`.
      1. Assert that `key` is a _literal_.
      1. Let `ksV` be the _annotated formattable value_ of `key`.
      1. Assert that `ksV` has a `formattable-value` field with value `ks`.
      1. Let `matches` be the list of strings at index `i` of `pref`.
      1. If `matches` includes `ks`:
         1. Continue the inner loop on `pref`.
      1. Else:
         1. Continue the outer loop on message _variants_.
   1. Append `var` as the last element of the list `vars`.

### Sort Variants

Finally, sort the list of variants `vars` and select the _pattern_:

1. Let `sortable` be a new empty list of (integer, _variant_) tuples.
1. For each _variant_ `var` of `vars`:
   1. Let `tuple` be a new tuple (-1, `var`).
   1. Append `tuple` as the last element of the list `sortable`.
1. Let `len` be the integer count of items in `pref`.
1. Let `i` be `len` - 1.
1. While `i` >= 0:
   1. Let `matches` be the list of strings at index `i` of `pref`.
   1. Let `minpref` be the integer count of items in `matches`.
   1. For each tuple `tuple` of `sortable`:
      1. Let `matchpref` be an integer with the value `minpref`.
      1. Let `key` be the `tuple` _variant_ key at position `i`.
      1. If `key` is not the catch-all key `'*'`:
         1. Assert that `key` is a _literal_.
         1. Let `ksV` be the _annotated formattable value_ of `key`.
         1. Assert that `ksV` has a `formattable-value` field with value `ks`.
         1. Let `matchpref` be the integer position of `ks` in `matches`.
      1. Set the `tuple` integer value as `matchpref`.
   1. Set `sortable` to be the result of calling the method `SortVariants(sortable)`.
   1. Set `i` to be `i` - 1.
1. Let `var` be the _variant_ element of the first element of `sortable`.
1. Select the _pattern_ of `var`.

`SortVariants` is a method whose single argument is
a list of (integer, _variant_) tuples.
It returns a list of (integer, _variant_) tuples.
Any implementation of `SortVariants` is acceptable
as long as it satisfies the following requirements:

1. Let `sortable` be an arbitrary list of (integer, _variant_) tuples.
1. Let `sorted` be `SortVariants(sortable)`.
1. `sorted` is the result of sorting `sortable` using the following comparator:
   1. `(i1, v1)` <= `(i2, v2)` if and only if `i1 <= i2`.
1. The sort is stable (pairs of tuples from `sortable` that are equal
   in their first element have the same relative order in `sorted`).

### Examples

_This section is non-normative._

#### Example 1

Presuming a minimal implementation which only supports `:string` annotation
which matches keys by using string comparison on the following string:
* If the input _annotated formattable value_ has a `preformatted-value`
  field, and the value of that field has a `formatter-output` field
  whose value is a strin, use that string for comparison.
and a formatting context in which
the variable reference `$foo` resolves to an _annotated formattable value_
whose `preformatted-value` has a `formatter-output` that is the string `'foo'`
and the variable reference `$bar` resolves to an _annotated formattable value_
whose `preformatted-value` has a `formatter-output` that is the string `'bar'`,
pattern selection proceeds as follows for this message:

```
.match {$foo :string} {$bar :string}
bar bar {{All bar}}
foo foo {{All foo}}
* * {{Otherwise}}
```

1. For the first selector:<br>
   The _annotated formattable value_ of the selector is resolved to be:
   ```
   { source-text: '{$foo :string}',
     preformatted-value: {
        /* Other fields not shown */
        formatter-output: 'foo' } }
   ```<br>
   The available keys « `'bar'`, `'foo'` » are compared to `'foo'`,<br>
   resulting in a list « `'foo'` » of matching keys.

2. For the second selector:<br>
   The _annotated formattable value_ of the selector is resolved to be:
   ```
   { source-text: '{$bar :string}',
     preformatted-value: {
        /* Other fields not shown */
        formatter-output: 'bar' } }
   ```<br>
   The available keys « `'bar'`, `'foo'` » are compared to `'bar'`,<br>
   resulting in a list « `'bar'` » of matching keys.

3. Creating the list `vars` of variants matching all keys:<br>
   The first variant `bar bar` is discarded as its first key does not match the first selector.<br>
   The second variant `foo foo` is discarded as its second key does not match the second selector.<br>
   The catch-all keys of the third variant `* *` always match, and this is added to `vars`,<br>
   resulting in a list « `* *` » of variants.

4. As the list `vars` only has one entry, it does not need to be sorted.<br>
   The pattern `Otherwise` of the third variant is selected.

#### Example 2

Alternatively, with the same implementation and formatting context as in Example 1,
pattern selection would proceed as follows for this message:

```
.match {$foo :string} {$bar :string}
* bar {{Any and bar}}
foo * {{Foo and any}}
foo bar {{Foo and bar}}
* * {{Otherwise}}
```

1. For the first selector:<br>
   The `formatter-output` of the `preformatted-value`
   of the _annotated formattable value_ of the selector is resolved to be `'foo'`.<br>
   The available keys « `'foo'` » are compared to `'foo'`,<br>
   resulting in a list « `'foo'` » of matching keys.

2. For the second selector:<br>
   The `formatter-output` of the `preformatted-value`
   of the _annotated formattable value_ of the selector is resolved to be `'bar'`.<br>
   The available keys « `'bar'` » are compared to `'bar'`,<br>
   resulting in a list « `'bar'` » of matching keys.

3. Creating the list `vars` of variants matching all keys:<br>
   The keys of all variants either match each selector exactly, or via the catch-all key,<br>
   resulting in a list « `* bar`, `foo *`, `foo bar`, `* *` » of variants.

4. Sorting the variants:<br>
   The list `sortable` is first set with the variants in their source order
   and scores determined by the second selector:<br>
   « ( 0, `* bar` ), ( 1, `foo *` ), ( 0, `foo bar` ), ( 1, `* *` ) »<br>
   This is then sorted as:<br>
   « ( 0, `* bar` ), ( 0, `foo bar` ), ( 1, `foo *` ), ( 1, `* *` ) ».<br>
   To sort according to the first selector, the scores are updated to:<br>
   « ( 1, `* bar` ), ( 0, `foo bar` ), ( 0, `foo *` ), ( 1, `* *` ) ».<br>
   This is then sorted as:<br>
   « ( 0, `foo bar` ), ( 0, `foo *` ), ( 1, `* bar` ), ( 1, `* *` ) ».<br>

5. The pattern `Foo and bar` of the most preferred `foo bar` variant is selected.

#### Example 3

A more-complex example is the matching found in selection APIs
such as ICU's `PluralFormat`.
Suppose that this API is represented here by the function `:plural`.
This `:plural` function can match a given numeric value to a specific number _literal_
and **_also_** to a plural category (`zero`, `one`, `two`, `few`, `many`, `other`)
according to locale rules defined in CLDR.

Given a variable reference `$count` whose _nameable value_
resolves to an _annotated formattable value_
with the number `1` as its `formattable-value` field
and an `en` (English) locale,
the pattern selection proceeds as follows for this message:

```
.match {$count :plural}
one {{Category match}}
1   {{Exact match}}
*   {{Other match}}
```

1. For the selector:<br>
   The selector is resolved to the _annotated formattable value_:
   ```
   { source-text: '{$count :plural}',
     preformatted-value: {
       options: { },
       formatter: Plural,
       formatter-input: { source-text: '$count', formattable-value: 1 },
       formatter-output: FB }}
   ```
   where `FV` is an implementation-defined value
   that is capable of performing English plural category selection on
   the value of the `formattable-value` field (here, `1`).<br>
   The available keys « `'one'`, `'1'` » are passed to
   the implementation's MatchSelectorKeys method,<br>
   resulting in a list « `'1'`, `'one'` » of matching keys.

2. Creating the list `vars` of variants matching all keys:<br>
   The keys of all variants are included in the list of matching keys, or use the catch-all key,<br>
   resulting in a list « `one`, `1`, `*` » of variants.

3. Sorting the variants:<br>
   The list `sortable` is first set with the variants in their source order
   and scores determined by the selector key order:<br>
   « ( 1, `one` ), ( 0, `1` ), ( 2, `*` ) »<br>
   This is then sorted as:<br>
   « ( 0, `1` ), ( 1, `one` ), ( 2, `*` ) »<br>

4. The pattern `Exact match` of the most preferred `1` variant is selected.

#### Example 4

```
.local $a = {1 :number minIntegerDigits=3} // formats as 001.
.local $b = {$a :number minFractionDigits=3} // formats as 001.000
// min integer digits are preserved from the previous call.
```

Initially, the variable `a` is bound to a _nameable value_ that, when _forced_,
yields the following _annotated formattable value_:

```
{ source-text: '{1 :number minIntegerDigits=3}',
  preformatted-value: {
    options: { 'minIntegerDigits': { source-text: '3', formattable-value: '3' }},
    formatter: Number,
    formatter-input: { source-text: '1', formattable-value: '1' },
    formatter-output: FormattedNumber('001.') }}
```

Then, `$b` is bound to a _nameable value_ (which, in a lazy implementation,
records that the variable `$a` is in scope when _forcing_ `$b`'s value).
When this _nameable value_ is _forced_
in an environment that binds `a` to the above _annotated formattable value_,
it yields the following _annotated formattable value_:

```
{ source-text: '{$a :number minFractionDigits=3}',
  pre-formatted-value: {
    options: { 'minFractionDigits': { source-text: '3', formattable-value: '3' }},
    formatter: Number,
    formatter-input: /* The _annotated formattable value_ above */,
    formatter-output: FormattedNumber(001.000) }
```

## Formatting

After _pattern selection_,
each _text_ and _placeholder_ part of the selected _pattern_ is resolved to
an _annotated formattable value_.
Each _placeholder_ part is first resolved to a _nameable value_,
which is then -forced_ to an _annotated formattable value_.
In other words, once a single _pattern_ has been selected,
every _expression_ that appears within it is evaluated
to an _annotated formattable value_.

Implementations MUST provide the functionality of formatting the resulting
sequence of _annotated formatted values_ to a single string
(for example, by extracting the `formatted-value` field from each value,
converting it to a string, and concatenating the strings together).

_Annotated formattable values_ cannot always be formatted by a given implementation.
When such an error occurs during _formatting_,
an implementation SHOULD emit a _Formatting Error_ and produce a
_fallback value_ for the _placeholder_ that produced the error.
A formatting function MAY return a value to be used instead of a _fallback value_.

Implementations MAY choose a _formatted value_ type that
represents the result of _formatting_ using the most
appropriate data type or structure. Some examples of these include:

- A single string concatenated from the parts of the resolved _pattern_.
- A string with associated attributes for portions of its text.
- A flat sequence of objects corresponding to each resolved value.
- A hierarchical structure of objects that group spans of resolved values,
  such as sequences delimited by _markup-open_ and _markup-close_ _placeholders_.

Implementations SHOULD provide _formatting_ result types that match user needs,
including situations that require further processing of formatted messages.
Implementations SHOULD encourage users to consider a formatted localised string
as an opaque data structure, suitable only for presentation.

When formatting to a string, the default representation of all _markup_
MUST be an empty string.
Implementations MAY offer functionality for customizing this,
such as by emitting XML-ish tags for each _markup_.

_Attributes_ are reserved for future standardization.
Other than checking for valid syntax, they SHOULD NOT 
affect the processing or output of a _message_.

### Examples

_This section is non-normative._

1. An implementation might choose a _formatted value_ type that is an interstitial object
   such that the caller can "decorate" portions of the _formatted value_.
   In ICU4J, the `NumberFormatter` class returns a `FormattedNumber` object,
   so a _pattern_ such as `This is my number {42 :number}` might format to a sequence
   of two _annotated formatted values_: first,
   one whose `formatted-value` field is the character sequence `This is my number `,
   followed by one whose `formatted-value` field is
   a `FormattedNumber` object representing the value `42` in the current locale.

2. A formatter in a web browser could format a message as a DOM fragment
   rather than as a representation of its HTML source.

### Formatting Fallback Values

If the resolved _pattern_ includes any _fallback values_
and the formatting result is a concatenated string or a sequence of strings,
the string representation of each _fallback value_ MUST be the concatenation of
a U+007B LEFT CURLY BRACKET `{`,
the `fallback` field of the _fallback value_,
and a U+007D RIGHT CURLY BRACKET `}`.

> For example,
> a message with a _Syntax Error_ and no fallback string
> defined in the _formatting context_ would format to a string as `{�}`.

### Handling Bidirectional Text

_Messages_ contain text. Any text can be 
[bidirectional text](https://www.w3.org/TR/i18n-glossary/#dfn-bidirectional-text).
That is, the text can can consist of a mixture of left-to-right and right-to-left spans of text.
The display of bidirectional text is defined by the
[Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm](http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr9/) [UAX9].

The directionality of the message as a whole is provided by the _formatting context_.

When a _message_ is formatted, _placeholders_ are replaced
with their formatted representation.
Applying the Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm to the text of a formatted _message_ 
(including its formatted parts)
can result in unexpected or undesirable 
[spillover effects](https://www.w3.org/TR/i18n-glossary/#dfn-spillover-effects).
Applying [bidi isolation](https://www.w3.org/TR/i18n-glossary/#dfn-bidi-isolation)
to each affected formatted value helps avoid this spillover in a formatted _message_.

Note that both the _message_ and, separately, each _placeholder_ need to have
direction metadata for this to work.
If an implementation supports formatting to something other than a string
(such as a sequence of parts),
the directionality of each formatted _placeholder_ needs to be available to the caller.

If a formatted _expression_ itself contains spans with differing directionality,
its formatter SHOULD perform any necessary processing, such as inserting controls or
isolating such parts to ensure that the formatted value displays correctly in a plain text context.

> For example, an implementation could provide a `:currency` formatting function
> which inserts strongly directional characters, such as U+200F RIGHT-TO-LEFT MARK (RLM),
> U+200E LEFT-TO-RIGHT MARK (LRM), or U+061C ARABIC LETTER MARKER (ALM), 
> to coerce proper display of the sign and currency symbol next to a formatted number.
> An example of this is formatting the value `-1234.56` as the currency `AED`
> in the `ar-AE` locale. The formatted value appears like this:
> ```
> ‎-1,234.56 د.إ.‏
> ```
> The code point sequence for this string, as produced by the ICU4J `NumberFormat` function,
> includes **U+200F U+200E** at the start and **U+200F** at the end of the string.
> If it did not do this, the same string would appear like this instead:
> 
> ![image](https://github.com/unicode-org/message-format-wg/assets/69082/6cc7f16f-8d9b-400b-a333-ae2ddb316edb)

A **_bidirectional isolation strategy_** is functionality in the formatter's
processing of a _message_ that produces bidirectional output text that is ready for display.

The **_Default Bidi Strategy_** is a _bidirectional isolation strategy_ that uses
isolating Unicode control characters around _placeholder_'s formatted values.
It is primarily intended for use in plain-text strings, where markup or other mechanisms
are not available.
Implementations MUST provide the _Default Bidi Strategy_ as one of the 
_bidirectional isolation strategies_.

Implementations MAY provide other _bidirectional isolation strategies_.

Implementations MAY supply a _bidirectional isolation strategy_ that performs no processing.

The _Default Bidi Strategy_ is defined as follows:

1. Let `msgdir` be the directionality of the whole message,
   one of « `'LTR'`, `'RTL'`, `'unknown'` ».
   These correspond to the message having left-to-right directionality,
   right-to-left directionality, and to the message's directionality not being known.
1. For each _expression_ `exp` in _pattern_:
   1. Let `fmt` be the formatted string representation of the resolved value of `exp`.
   1. Let `dir` be the directionality of `fmt`,
      one of « `'LTR'`, `'RTL'`, `'unknown'` », with the same meanings as for `msgdir`.
   1. If `dir` is `'LTR'`:
      1. If `msgdir` is `'LTR'`
         in the formatted output, let `fmt` be itself
      1. Else, in the formatted output,
         prefix `fmt` with U+2066 LEFT-TO-RIGHT ISOLATE
         and postfix it with U+2069 POP DIRECTIONAL ISOLATE.
   1. Else, if `dir` is `'RTL'`:
      1. In the formatted output,
         prefix `fmt` with U+2067 RIGHT-TO-LEFT ISOLATE
         and postfix it with U+2069 POP DIRECTIONAL ISOLATE.
   1. Else:
      1. In the formatted output,
         prefix `fmt` with U+2068 FIRST STRONG ISOLATE
         and postfix it with U+2069 POP DIRECTIONAL ISOLATE.
